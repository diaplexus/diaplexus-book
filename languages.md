Elm is a functional language is inspired by and written in the Haskell. It seems to aim to employ a minimal subset of Haskell's features striking a balance between high utility and ease of access. The language compiles to Javascript and utilizes a port system for typed interop with the Javascript ecosystem.

Some notable features include:

* Union types
* Embedding as a DOM element
* Enforced semantic versioning for package ecosystem
* The Elm Architecture
