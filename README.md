# Diaplexus Book

A collection of resources on programming concepts.

This is not so much a book as it is an attempt to organize resources collected in pursuit of a set of loosely related ideas that tend to center around software development. Some of these ideas include:

* Graceful increase of complexity
* Semantic code editing
* Functional programming
* Distributed programming
* Decentralized computing
* Literate programming
* Compositional user interfaces
* Live programming environments

These documents are not authored by an expert in any of the related fields and should be interpreted as a student's attempt at understanding and surveying the landscape. Contributions, comments, and criticism are welcomed.
